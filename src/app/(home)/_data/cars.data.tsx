It handled beautifully on the winding roads and offered great fuel efficiency, which was a big plus for our long drives across the island.",

The only thing I didn't see in the rental conditions was a payment for a car wash of 400 baht at the end of the rental period, since the car was quite dirty after two weeks of use. Otherwise, everything went smoothly and quite easily. Next time I will contact the same company.",

There is a lot of space in the cabin and we, five adults, were not cramped or uncomfortable during long trips around Thailand. Thanks to this crossover, we were able to visit a large number of Phuket attractions on our own and not pay money to an agent. I recommend taking a car because without it, it will be very difficult in Phuket.",

The only thing is that when the car was left in an open parking lot without a canopy, the sun's rays penetrated into the interior and heated the leather seats. When getting into the car, it was uncomfortable at first because the seats were quite hot for my body. Rather, this is a disadvantage of Thailand, not a specific car. In all other respects, the car rental went smoothly, the car was delivered on time, clean, with a full tank.",
